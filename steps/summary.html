            Now you know to use the basics of using Lambdatest to test your website, either manually or by automation.
            If you want to integrate even more automation to your testing process, then the next step would be to use CI to automatically test new code that is pushed to a branch on git.
            You can find more information on CI integration tools and Lambdatest following <a href="https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/integrations-with-ci-cd-tools/">this link</a>.
