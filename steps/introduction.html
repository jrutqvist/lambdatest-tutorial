        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>About testing</h2>
        <p>
            Testing is one of the most central and important aspects when it comes to developing any type of software, but it is
            also known to be one of the most time consuming and boring aspects of programming, at least if you are working with
            manual testing. Enter automated testing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead of having a human being responsible for testing the functionality of the software, this process is fully
            automated through an automation tool (such as Lambdatest) so that less time is spent on writing and developing tests
            and more time is spent on actually maintaining and improving your code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Automated tests are however not always the best approach for testing. Manual testing is favorable in the sense that
            a human can better draw insights from the tests that could be missed by an automated testing program. Automated
            tests are also not optimal when testing a smaller sized project but are instead better to use in projects that need
            to be tested for the same thing over and over.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Lambdatest?</h2>
        <p>
            Lambdatest is a cloud-based test automation service that provides cross-browser testing on real browsers and
            operating systems, all done via their web application. In addition to automated testing, Lambdatest can also be used
            for live responsive testing and even screenshot comparison testing, which involves visually comparing test cases
            against a reference image.
